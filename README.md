PAC - Passive and Active Computation

Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW)

PAC (Passive and Active Computation) is a tool designed for processing and analyzing multichannel surface wave data. It integrates both passive and active seismic data to extract dispersion curves and estimate subsurface shear wave velocity profiles.



Features

Hybrid Processing: Supports both passive and active MASW methods.

Automated Dispersion Analysis: Extracts and visualizes dispersion curves.

Signal Processing Tools: Includes filtering, spectral analysis, and denoising functions.

Velocity Inversion: Computes shear wave velocity profiles from dispersion data.

User-Friendly Interface: Streamlined workflow with visualization capabilities.

Python-Based: Lightweight and extensible for custom modifications.
